         Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet



[Over the caption December 31st 1999 a crude spaceship flies
through space, cruising over and under planets and a man speaks.]



                     MAN
         (voice-over) Space. It seems to go on
         and on forever. But then you get to
         the end and the gorilla starts throwing
         barrels at you.


[A planet opens up and a huge gorilla starts throwing barrels
at the spaceship. It dodges a few but one hits it and it explodes.
The gorilla thumps its chest and "Game Over" flashes on the screen.
The spaceship and gorilla isn't real and the man, called Fry,
was playing an arcade game called "Monkey Fracas Jr". He is in
his mid-20s, wears a red jacket and has orange hair with two
distinct forks at the front. There is a little kid standing next
to him. The game is against the wall in a pizzeria called Panucci's
Pizza.]


                     FRY
         And that's how you play the game!


                     KID
         You stink, loser!


[Mr Panucci, a middle-aged balding man wearing a vest, leans
over the counter with a pizza box.]


                     PANUCCI
         Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out! C'mon!!



[Fry sighs, takes the pizza from him and walks out.]


[New York Street. Fry cycles past people enjoying their New Millennium
Eve. A cab pulls up and he sees his girlfriend inside.]


                     FRY
         Michelle, baby! Where you going?


                     MICHELLE
         It's not working out, Fry.   I put your
         stuff out on the sidewalk!


[Time Lapse. Fry is still on his bike getting more and more depressed.]



                     FRY
         I hate my life I hate my life I hate
         my life.


[Cut to: Outside Applied Cryogenics. He stops outside a building
and locks up his bike. A man sneaks up behind him, cuts the chain
and steals his bike.]


                     BIKE THIEF
         Happy new year!


[Applied Cryogenics. Fry steps out of the elevator on the 64th
floor. He knocks on a door marked Applied Cryogenics. A sign
underneath indicates No Power Failures Since 199[7]. No one opens
the door so Fry goes in.]


[Cut to: Cryogenics Lab. The room is empty and there are no lights
on. Strange pods about 6ft tall line one of the walls. There
are a few other machines around the room and a desk and a chair
in the middle of the room. Fry wipes some condensation from a
window on one of the pods, revealing the face of an inanimate
man inside. He turns around.]


                     FRY
         Hello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?!
         Aw, crud! I always thought at this point
         in my life I'd be the one making the
         crank calls!  Here's to another lousy
         millennium.


[He unenthusiastically raises his hand and toasts.]


[Cut to: Time Square. Crowds have gathered for the countdown.
10 appears on a huge screen.]


                     CROWD
         Ten!


[Cut to: Paris. A screen on the Eiffel Tower displays 9.]


                     CROWD
         Neuf!


[Cut to: Vatican City. The Pope holds up a sign with "VIII" on
it.]


                     CROWD
         Otto!


[Cut to: Egypt. Egyptians crowd around the pyramids.]


                     CROWD
         Sabaa!


[Cut to: Athens. People are gathered around the Parthelon.]



                     CROWD
         Eksi!


[Cut to: Great Wall Of China.]


                     CROWD
         Wu!


[Cut to: Taj Mahal.]


                     CROWD
         Chaar!


[Cut to: African Village.]


                     CROWD
         Thathu!


[Cut to: Tokyo. A screen displays 2.]


                     CROWD
         Wu!


[From space the whole planet sees in the new millennium.]


                     CROWD
         One!


[Cut to: Cryogenics Lab. Fry unenthusiastically blows a party
blower and starts losing his balance on the chair. It tips back.
Fry waves his arms around trying to regain his balance. As he
falls he doesn't see the shadow of a small creature under the
desk. The chair tips back and Fry falls off it and rolls backwards
into cryogenic freezer number 40. The dial on the machine automatically
sets itself for 1000 years.]


                     FRY
         What the?


[He looks around and screams. In a flash he is frozen in time.]



[Time Lapse.Days and nights and eventually years pass ï¿½ la The
Time Machine as he stays locked in the freezer. Civilisation
is destroyed by aliens twice until eventually huge buildings
spring up around Applied Cryogenics. The timer stops 1000 years
later and the door opens. Fry is unfrozen. Initially disorientated,
he stumbles around and notices something to his right. He presses
his face against a large window and stares in awe.]


                     FRY
         My God! It's the future. My parents,
         my co-workers, my girlfriend. I'll never
         see any of them again. Yahoo!


[Opening Credits. Caption: In Color.]


[Cryogenics Lab. Fry is still looking out of the window. The
door opens and two shadows walk in.]


                     MAN
         (dramatically) Welcome to the world
         of tomorrow!


[The other shadow turns on the light. They are lab technicians
both wearing white lab coats. The dramatic one is called Terry.
He is a blonde Caucasian with large glasses. The other is called
Lou, a black haired Asian.]


                     LOU
         Why do you always have to say it that
         way?


                     TERRY
         Haven't you ever heard of a little thing
         called showmanship?  (dramatically)
         Come, your destiny awaits!


[Applied Cryogenics Corridor. The technicians leave Fry outside
the Fate Assignment Officer's office.]


                     LOU
         Have a nice future.


[The door slides open.]


                     FRY
         Cool! Just like in Star Trek!  Ow!



[Cut to: Fate Assignment Officer's Office. A woman wearing a
black uniform stands with her back to Fry looking at a clipboard.
She has purple hair held up in a ponytail.]


                     WOMAN
         Good afternoon, sir.  Name?


                     FRY
         Uh, Fry.


                     WOMAN
         I'm Leela. Now it's New Year's Eve so
         I'd like to decide your fate quickly
         and get out of here.


                     FRY
         Can I ask you a question?


                     LEELA
         As long as it's not about my eye.


                     FRY
         Uh...


                     LEELA
         Is it about my eye?


                     FRY
         Sort of.


[Leela sighs.]


                     LEELA
         Just ask the question.


                     FRY
         What's with the eye?


                     LEELA
         I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop
         the subject.


                     FRY
         Cool, an alien! Has your race taken
         over the Earth?


                     LEELA
         No, I just work here.


[Fry looks out the window. A passing blimp wishes people a Happy
New Year 3000. Leela follows his gaze.]


                     FRY
         Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?



                     LEELA
         Yep. It's December 31st 2999.


                     FRY
         My God, a million years!


                     LEELA
         I'm sure this must be very upsetting
         for you.


                     FRY
         Y'know, I guess it should be but actually
         I'm glad. I had nothing to live for
         in my old life. I was broke, I had a
         humiliating job and I was beginning
         to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating
         on me.


                     LEELA
         Well, at least here you'll be treated
         with dignity. Now strip naked and get
         on the probulator.


[Probulator Room. Fry lies on a metal table surrounded by lots
of things designed to probe him. Leela puts a single lensed goggle
on and presses a button. Fry squeaks.]


[Time Lapse. Leela tears off a printout and reads it while Fry
starts to get dressed.]


                     LEELA
         Interesting. Your DNA test shows one
         living relative. He's your great great
         great great great great great...


[Time Lapse. Fry is now fully dressed.]


                     LEELA
         ...great great great great great nephew.



                     FRY
         That's great! What's the little guy's
         name?


                     LEELA
         Professor Hubert Farnsworth.


[She turns the page over to show Fry the photo. Farnsworth is
an old bald man who wears thick glasses.]


                     FRY
         Eurgh!


[Fate Assignment Officer's Office. Leela types something on a
computer.]


                     FRY
         Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the
         whole future. I've been given a second
         chance and this time I'm not going to
         be a total loser.  What's that?


                     LEELA
         Your permanent career assignment.


[She turns the screen around to show him his career. "Career:
Delivery Boy" is all that is written on the screen.]


                     FRY
         Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please!
         Anything else!


[He grabs Leela's hand.]


                     LEELA
         Take your hands off me! You've been
         assigned the job you're best at just
         like everyone else.


                     FRY
         What if I refuse?


                     LEELA
         Then you'll be fired...


                     FRY
         Fine!


                     LEELA
         ...out of a cannon into the Sun!


                     FRY
         But I don't like being a delivery boy.



                     LEELA
         Well that's tough! Lots of people don't
         like their jobs but we do them anyway.
          You gotta do what you gotta do! Now
         hold out your hand, I'm gonna implant
         your career chip. It'll permanently
         label you as a delivery boy.


[She picks up an implant gun. It has two huge spikes on the end.]



                     FRY
         Keep that thing away from me!


[He gets up and runs out of the room.]


[Cut to: Applied Cryogenics Corridor. He runs from the office
into another room.]


[Cut to: Cryogenics Lab. Leela runs in after Fry and he dodges
the implant gun.]


                     LEELA
         Hold still, damnit. I don't have good
         depth perception!  You've got until
         the count of five to let me out of here.
         One...


[In a flash she is frozen.]


                     FRY
         See you in a thousand years!  You owe
         me one.


[New New York Street. Fry runs out of the building and looks
in awe at the sights around him.]


                     FRY
         Whoa!


[Spaceships take off, there are traffic jams in the sky and billboards
advertising Bachelor Chow. A couple walk past him nearly naked
except for some strategically placed black bars. He looks up
and sees people flying through a green tube overhead. He walks
around a corner and finds an entrance to the tube. A pedestrian
steps in.]


                     MAN #1
         JFK Jr. Airport.


[The man is sucked up into the tube.]


                     FRY
         Cool!  Um. Cross Town Express?


[The tube sucks him up and he screams as he flies through it.
People look up from the street and stare at him. He is taken
across the city, past the Statue of Liberty, underwater and finally
out the other end smack into a building. A man looks up from
his newspaper.]


                     MAN #2
         Pft! Tourist!


[Time Lapse. A hover-car flies over a line of traffic on the
road and a police car chases it. Fry walks around a corner and
sees a line of people outside a small grey booth.]


                     FRY
         Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew.
          Wow, a real live robot! Or is that
         some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?



                     ROBOT
         Bite my shiny metal ass.


[Fry looks around at the robot's ass.]


                     FRY
         It doesn't look so shiny to me.


                     ROBOT
         Shinier than yours, meatbag!


[Fry steps into the phone booth. He overlooks the important sign
outside that differentiates it from normal phone booths. It is
actually a suicide booth.]


[Cut to: Suicide Booth. Fry presses a button and nothing happens.
The robot steps in behind him.]


                     ROBOT
         Listen, buddy, I'm in a hurry here.
         Let's try for a twofer!


[He puts a coin on a string in the slot then pulls it out again
and chuckles. A pleasant woman's voice speaks.]


                     BOOTH VOICE
         Please select mode of death: "Quick
         And Painless" or "Slow And Horrible".



                     FRY
         Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call.



                     BOOTH VOICE
         You have selected: "Slow And Horrible".



                     ROBOT
         Great choice!  Bring it on, baby!


[Fry screams.]


[Time Lapse. The robot is getting impatient.]


                     ROBOT
         C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the
         way, my name's Bender!


[He holds out his hand.]


                     FRY
         Help! What's happening?


[The sharp things lunge at them. Fry pushes Bender to the side
of the booth. The sharp things stab and twist at the air and
finally return to behind the hatch.]


                     BOOTH VOICE
         You are now dead. Thank you for using
         Stop-N-Drop, America's favourite suicide
         booth since 2008.


[Cut to: New New York Street. Fry runs out gasping.]


                     BENDER
         Lousy stinking rip-off!  Well I didn't
         have anything else planned for today.
         Let's go get drunk!


[Cryogenics Lab. The timer on Leela's chamber runs out. The door
opens and she defrosts.]


                     LEELA
         ...two, three -- Hey!


                     TERRY
         (dramatically) Welcome to the world
         of tomorrow!


                     LEELA
         Shut up, Terry.


[Ipgee's Office. Leela's boss sits behind a large desk and she
stands in front of it.]


                     IPGEE
         This is unacceptable, Leela. You must
         find this Mr. Fry and install his chip.



                     LEELA
         Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't
         want to be a delivery boy. I'd really
         rather not force it on him.


                     IPGEE
         Well that's your job, whether you like
         it or not and it's my job to make you
         do your job whether I like it or not
         - which I do - very much! Now get to
         work!  Life is good!


[O'Zorgnax's Pub. Fry and Bender are sat at the bar. Bender drinks
a bottle of Olde Fortran malt liquor.]


                     FRY
         Why would a robot need to drink?


                     BENDER
         I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime
         I want!  So they made you a delivery
         boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.



                     FRY
         Really? What do you do Bender?


                     BENDER
         I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's
         all I'm programmed to do.


                     FRY
         You any good at it?


                     BENDER
         You kidding? I was a star! I could bend
         a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32
         degrees, you name it! (unsure) 31. (normal)
         But I couldn't go on living once I found
         out what the girders were for.


                     FRY
         What?


                     BENDER
         Suicide booths!  Well, Fry, it was a
         pleasure meeting you, I'm gonna go kill
         myself.


[He gets up.]


                     FRY
         Wait! You're the only friend I have!



                     BENDER
         You really want a robot for a friend?



                     FRY
         Yeah, ever since I was six.


                     BENDER
         Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking
         we're robo-sexuals, so if anyone asks,
         you're my debugger.


[Fry looks out the window and sees Leela.]


                     FRY
         Oh, no, it's the Cyclops!  Don't look!
         Don't look!


                     BENDER
         I'm not looking!


[His eyes zoom in to Leela.]


[Cut to: New New York Street. Leela shows Fry's photo to a man.
The man points to him inside the pub. Fry and Bender run off.
Leela talks into her wrist communicator.]


                     LEELA
         This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.



[The cops, Smitty the human and URL the robot, are standing right
behind Leela. Smitty replies in his wrist communicator.]


                     SMITTY
         We'll be there in five minutes.


[Outside Head Museum. Bender stops Fry outside the building.]



                     BENDER
         We can hide in here, it's free on Tuesdays.



[He runs up the steps dragging Fry behind him.]


[Cut to: Head Museum. Hundreds of heads in jars are stacked on
shelves. Leonard Nimoy's head in a jar is on a platform in the
middle of one of the rooms.]


                     NIMOY
         Welcome to the Head Museum. I'm Leonard
         Nimoy.


                     FRY
         Spock? Hey! Do the thing!


[He does the Vulcan salute from Star Trek. Nimoy chuckles.]



                     NIMOY
         I don't do that anymore.


                     FRY
         This is unbelievable! What do you heads
         do all day?


                     NIMOY
         We share our wisdom with those who seek
         it. It's a life of quiet dignity.



[Enter a woman.]


                     WOMAN
         Feeding time!


[She shakes a box of what looks like fish food over the jar.
Nimoy eats what comes out.]


[The door opens and Fry turns around. Enter Leela, Smitty and
URL.]


                     LEELA
         Hmm.


[She looks around and sees Fry and Bender hiding behind a shelf
in amongst other assorted heads.]


                     LEELA
         I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install
         your career chip.


                     FRY
         Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are
         you doing it?


                     LEELA
         It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta
         do!


[Fry backs away and hits a shelf with the heads of US presidents
on it.]


                     LEELA
         Watch it!


[Richard Nixon's head falls off. The jar smashes.]


                     NIXON
         That's it! You just made my list!


[He jumps up and starts biting Fry's arm.]


                     FRY
         Ow! Stoppit! Down boy! Bad president!



[Bender tries to pull Nixon's head off.]


                     SMITTY
         Alright, buddy, step away from the head!



[Fry and Bender put their hands up.]


                     URL
         I'm gonna get 24th century on his ass!



[They turn on their lightsabers and start to hit Fry.]


                     LEELA
         Please, officers, there's no need to
         use force.


                     URL
         Let us handle this, weirdy.


[He hits Bender.]


                     LEELA
         Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from
         the Stupid Ages.


                     SMITTY
         Keep your big nose out of this, eyeball!



                     LEELA
         No-one makes fun of my nose.


[She kicks Smitty and URL. Fry and Bender run off and hide in
a room.]


                     URL
         Damn!


                     LEELA
         You guys were totally out of control.



                     SMITTY
         It's our job. We're peace officers.



                     URL
         Yeah, you know the law: You gotta do
         what you gotta do.


[Leela considers.]


[Head Museum Hall Of Criminals. Bender locks the door.]


                     BENDER
         Oh, we're trapped!


[Fry looks to the end of the room. There is a window with bars
across it.]


                     FRY
         Wait a second. You're a bender, right?
         We can get out of here if you just bend
         the bars.


                     BENDER
         Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed
         to bend for constructive purposes. What
         do I look like, a de-bender?


                     FRY
         Who cares what you're programmed for.
         If someone programmed you to jump off
         a bridge would you do it?


                     BENDER
         I'll have to check my program...yep.



                     LEELA
          Open up!


                     FRY
         C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make
         your own decisions in life. That's what
         separates people and robots from animals...and
         animal robots.


                     BENDER
         You're full of crap, Fry!  You make
         a persuasive argument, Fry.


[He starts to bend the bars.]


                     FRY
         Come on, Bender! You can do it.


                     BENDER
         Can't...I...can't...do...it!


[The bars bend and break off completely.]


                     FRY
         Yes!


                     BENDER
         You were right, Fry! From now on I'm
         going to bend what I want, when I want,
         who I want! I'm unstoppable!


[His arms fall off but he manages to somehow reattach them without
any help.]


                     FRY
         I don't know how you did that.


[Leela kicks the door open. Fry and Bender dive out through the
window.]


[Cut to: Outside Head Museum. Fry runs off and Bender bends the
bars back so Leela can't climb through. He runs after Fry and
Leela reaches out through the bars.]


                     LEELA
         Wait!


                     BENDER
         (shouting) No, thanks.


[Cut to: Alley. Fry and Bender stop at a dead end. There is a
drain below them with a grate over the top.]


                     BENDER
         Looks like one of us will have to bend
         this grate.


[He flexes his fingers but Fry just lifts it. Bender sighs and
they climb down the ladder. He reaches back up to the grate and
bends it just for the hell of it. He chuckles and follows Fry.]



[Ruins Of Old New York. Fry and Bender step off the ladder and
look over the vast ruins of the city that looks like the city
from Beneath The Planet Of The Apes. Collapsed buildings and
rubble litter the streets and holes in the roof let in a few
shafts of light, giving the place and eerie atmosphere.]


                     FRY
         Good Lord! What is this?


                     BENDER
         It's the decaying ruins of Old New York.
         Welcome home, pal!


[Time Lapse. Fry and Bender walk down an old ruined street.]



                     FRY
         Its my old neighbourhood. Man, this
         brings back a lot of memories.


                     BENDER
         Keep 'em to yourself, pops.


[Cut to: Ruins of Rockefeller Center Skating Rink. Fry leans
over a wall.]


                     FRY
         This is where I brought my girlfriend
         on our very first date.


[Flashback. Fry skates with Michelle on the crowded ice.]


[Flashback ends. The ice is gone, replaced with murky green waters
inhabited by a green tentacled creature.]


                     FRY
         My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever
         knew or cared about is gone.


                     BENDER
         Wait! There's someone you know!


[He points at Leela, standing with her implant gun.]


                     FRY
         Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable
         enough already.


                     LEELA
         Look, I know it's not much consolation
         but I understand how you feel.


                     FRY
         No, you don't. I've got no home, no
         family...


[Bender leans in behind him.]


                     BENDER
         No friends.


                     FRY
         ...My whole world is gone. You can't
         possibly understand what it feels like
         to be so alone.


                     LEELA
         I understand. I'm the only one-eyed
         alien on this whole planet. My parents
         abandoned me here as a baby and I don't
         even know what galaxy they were from.
         I know how it feels to be alone.


                     FRY
         Look, Leela, I don't understand this
         world but you obviously do, so I give
         up. If you really think I should be
         a delivery boy, I'll do it.  Your chip.
         What are you doing?


                     LEELA
         Quitting.


                     FRY
         Why?


                     LEELA
         Because I've always wanted to. I just
         never realised it before I met you.



[She puts her hand on his and smiles. Bender puts his hand on
top.]


                     FRY
         What is the matter with you?


[Bender quickly takes his hand off.]


                     BENDER
         I just wanted to be part of the moment.



                     LEELA
         Hey, he stole my ring!


                     BENDER
         Sorry.  Well, that solves the mystery
         of the missing ring. This calls for
         a drink.


[He reaches into his chest cabinet and pulls out three bottles
of beer...and drinks them all himself.]


                     LEELA
         I don't wanna spoil the party but we're
         all job deserters now. We're unemployed
         and we have nowhere to go.


                     FRY
         Correction. We're unemployed but we
         have a doddering old relative to mooch
         off of.


[He holds up the picture of Farnsworth.]


[Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lounge. Professor Farnsworth is
asleep in his chair. The TV is on and Dick Clark's head presents
and a programme.]


                     CLARK [ON TV]
         Hello, I'm Dick Clark's head. Welcome
         to a special year 3000 edition of New
         Year's Rockin' Eve!


[The crowds around him cheer. The doorbell rings and Farnsworth
wakes up.]


[Cut to: Outside Planet Express. Farnsworth opens the door to
Fry, Bender and Leela.]


                     FARNSWORTH
         Who are you?


                     FRY
         I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.


                     FARNSWORTH
         I don't have an Uncle Fry.


                     BENDER
         You do now!


[He pushes Farnsworth back inside.]


[Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lounge. Farnsworth and Fry are
hooked up to a DNA machine. It dings and a red light flashes.]



                     FARNSWORTH
         By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely
         incredible!


                     BENDER
         Can we have some money?


                     FARNSWORTH
         Oh, my, no.


[Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. The four walk in.]



                     FARNSWORTH
         Let me show you around. That's my lab
         table and this is my work-stool. And
         over there is my intergalactic spaceship!
          And here's where I keep assorted lengths
         of wire.


[He opens a drawer but Fry is more interested in what's in the
hangar.]


                     FRY
         Whoa! A real live spaceship!


                     FARNSWORTH
         I designed it myself. Let me show you
         some of the different lengths of wire
         I used.


                     SMITTY
          Attention, job deserters! Come out
         with your hands up. We have you partially
         surrounded.


[Leela gasps.]


                     FRY
         No!


[Bender literally shits a brick.]


[Cut to: Outside Planet Express. Smitty holds Nixon's head in
a jar. The glass is cracked and taped in places.]


                     NIXON
         Get those bums!


[Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab.]


                     BENDER
         Well, we're boned!


                     LEELA
         Can't we get away in the ship?


                     FARNSWORTH
         I suppose it is technically possible.
         Though I am already in my pyjamas.



[Fry and Leela run towards the ship and Bender carries Farnsworth
under his arm.]


[Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Fry runs in and sit in a seat in front
of a control panel.]


                     FRY
         I'll get us out of here.


[He presses a few buttons and pulls a lever. A little hatch opens
in the control panel, a paper cup come down and the machine fills
it with coffee.]


                     FARNSWORTH
         Can anyone drive stick?


                     LEELA
         I can. As long as I don't have to parallel
         park.


[She takes off her coat, sits in the pilot's seat and pushes
down a lever.]


[Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. Klaxons beep and a huge piece
of machinery lifts the ship to a 45-degree angle. The entire
hangar roof retracts so it is open for the ship.]


[Cut to: Outside Planet Express. There are now many peace officers
all armed with laser rifles stationed outside. URL sees the roof
open.]


                     URL
         If they try to take off, give 'em an
         ass-ful of laser.


[Smitty nods.]


[Cut to: Ships Cockpit.]


                     LEELA
         Prepare for lift-off. Ten.


[Cut to: Time Square.]


                     CROWD
         Nine!


[Cut to: Egypt. The future pyramids now rotate in mid air.]



                     CROWD
         Amania!


[Cut to: Paris.]


                     CROWD
         Seven!


[Cut to: Alien Ship.]


                     ALIENS
         (in alien) Six.


[Cut to: Cryogenics Lab. Lou sits in an open pod and Terry raises
a glass.]


                     TERRY
         (dramatically) Five!


[Cut to: Head Museum. Leonard Nimoy is wearing a party hat.]



                     NIMOY
         Four.


[Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Fry, Bender and Farnsworth are sat on
a couch at the front of the cockpit.]


                     FARNSWORTH
         Three.


                     BENDER
         Two.


[He is so tense that he rips the arms off the couch.]


                     LEELA
         One!


                     FRY
         Blast-off!


[Cut to: Outside Planet Express. The ship takes off.]


[Cut to: Times Square. People cheer in the new millennium and
fireworks explode all over the city. "3000" is projected onto
the moon and the ship flies between the fireworks.]


[Cut to: Outside Planet Express.]


                     NIXON
         Fire! Fire!


[The peace officers fire their laser gun randomly into the air.]



                     SMITTY
         I can't see nothing. Pretty though!



[The altitude of the ship increases and laser bolts narrowly
miss it.]


[Cut to: Ships Cockpit. The ship clears New New York airspace,
flies through the atmosphere and heads through the solar system.
Everyone cheers.]


                     FRY
         So I guess without jobs, we'll be fugitives
         forever.


                     FARNSWORTH
         Not necessarily. Are you three, by any
         chance, interested in becoming my new
         spaceship crew?


                     BENDER
         New crew? W-What happened to the old
         crew?


                     FARNSWORTH
         Of those poor sons of -- but that's
         not important. The important thing is
         I need a new crew. Anyone interested?



                     FRY
         Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've
         always wanted!


                     LEELA
         Thanks for the offer, Professor, but
         we don't have the proper career chips.



                     FARNSWORTH
         Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck
         would have it I saved the chips from
         my previous crew.


[He empties the career chips out of an envelope marked "Contents
Of Space Wasps Stomach".]


                     FRY
         This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through
         space fighting monsters and teaching
         alien women to lurve?


                     FARNSWORTH
         If by that you mean "transporting cargo"
         then yes. It's a little home business
         I started to fund my research.


                     FRY
         Cool! What's my job gonna be?


                     FARNSWORTH
         You will be responsible for ensuring
         that the cargo reaches its destination.



[The smile fades from Fry's face.]


                     FRY
         So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?


                     FARNSWORTH
         Exactly!


[Fry thinks for a moment but doesn't seem to mind.]


                     FRY
         Alright! I'm a delivery boy!


[He waves his hands in the air and the ship flies on.]


THE END
